# backend-practice-suite
A hands-on repository for learning, experimenting, and mastering backend development techniques.

# Backend Practice Suite

This repository is for my personal backend learning and practice.

I will use it to practice different backend topics over time, including:

* Core Java
* Spring Boot
* Databases (JPA/Hibernate)
* Security (Spring Security / JWT)
* Caching (Redis)
* Docker / containerization

## How I Use It

1. Write exercises or projects as I learn each topic.
2. Commit changes regularly to track progress.
3. Organize folders/modules gradually as I build more practice.
